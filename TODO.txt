1.a Allow the user to analyse the agents policies by saving every 10K training iteration a trial made by the agent (the user must be able to choose the time granularity)
1.b Make sure the HMM and CHMM are generating sequences of actions
1.c Remove flickering of images in analysis frame
1.d Why is there not VFE displayed
1.e Should the images and video be saved on the file system for faster reloading?
1.f Allow scrolling through images of reconstruction display
1.g Allow refresh of only one set of images in reconstruction display

2. (bonus) Allow the user to compute the representational similarities between the layers of two sets of agents
3. (bonus) Allow the user to visualise the variance of the latent spaces for different agents
4. (bonus) Allow the user to visualise the actions taken by the agent as training progresses and the entropy of the prior over actions
5. (bonus) Allow the agents and environments to be grouped within subdirectories
6. (bonus) Allow the addition of analysis widget, i.e., the analysis window starts with a default configuration but new widget can be added for further inspection
